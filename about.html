					<!-- Old about
					<p>My name is Justin Cook and am currently a third year student in the Mechatronics Engineering
					   Program at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. I grew up in Brampton, Ontario and, from
					the age of 4, had a keen interest in robotics; starting to use kits to make my own robotics from
					when I was 6. My interest in robotics lead me to decide to pursue Mechatronics Engineering as
					   the degree closest to my desire career in building, coding, and designing modern robots and
					   so in high school at North Park Secondary School I took Computer Engineering and Computer
					   Science courses. Now as I continue my studies I edge ever closer to realizing my dream of
					   working in the field of robotics.</p>-->
					<p>My name is Justin Cook and I am currently in my final year of studies at the University of Toronto 
						Institute of Aerospace Studies, where I'm completing a Master's of Engineering in Aerospace 
						Engineering with an Emphasis on Robotics. Previously, I completed my Bachelor of Engineering
						in Mechatronics at McMaster University. I chose to pursue Mechatronics Engineering and then 
						a Master's of Engineering due to my long-standing interest - from age 4 - in the field of robotics. 
						My interest in robotics along with the Institute of Aerospace Studies 
						excellent Robotics offering lead me to choose to complete my Master's there. 
						This early interest in robotics inspired my education choices and lead me to work on several robots,
						such as Sumobot at McMaster, over the years as both hobby and extracurricular projects, along with
						work on robots for classes. Currently, I am applying my controls knowledge from robotics to
						help design the ADCS subsystem for a CubeSat on the University of Toronto Aerospace Team.

					<p>Other than my keen interest in robotics, I have delved into other and similar fields along
					   with various hobbies. In fields related to robotics, I have enjoyed learning to create
					   desktop scripts and web applications and sites, such as this one, along with, of course,
					   building my own robots as hobbies and projects. In other fields, I have always had a strong
					   interest in history - particularly ancient Europe - and philosophy along with mathematics, 
						physics - particularly quantum physics -, and chemistry. Throughout my life I have also loved 
					   to use my spare time to read fantasy and science fiction novels, play hockey and soccer, learn 
					   martial arts and boxing, and bike.
